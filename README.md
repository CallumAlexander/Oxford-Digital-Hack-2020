<h3>The Story</h3>
This is our official repository for OxfordHack 2020, a digital hackathon hosted by the computer science society at the University of Oxford. <br>
We are four incoming 2nd years studying Computer Science related degrees at the University of Edinburgh. We are all new to hackathons and the prospect of building something amazing in 24hrs. For Joe, Ralph, and myself this was our second hackathon; it was Emily's first.
